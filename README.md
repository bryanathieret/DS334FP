# Early-Life Adversity and Alcohol Consumption
Current research in the field of adverse childhood events focuses on how the number of adversities a person experiences during early-life increases risk to impulsive and maladaptive behaviors, but there is currently no research that investigates how the type of adversity experienced can impact impulsive and maladaptive behaviors. Using the CDC The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey I investigate the relationship between 13 different types of early life adversities and alcohol consumption behavior.   
Quasipoisson regressions were used to determine differences in average relative risk for the number of days at least one alcoholic bevarage is consumed per week, the number of days at least one alcoholic bevarage is consumed per month, the occasions in the last month where binge drinking occurred, and the maximum number of alcoholic bevarages consumed on any occasion in the past month.  
Findings consist of those with a history of certain adversities having increased risk for excessive alcohol consumption with little evidence of those with more adversities having higher tendencies to engage in more alcohol consumption compared to those with fewer adverse childhood events or report no adverse childhood events.
